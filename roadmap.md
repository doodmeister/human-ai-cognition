# üß† Human-Like AI Cognitive Architecture ‚Äî Roadmap

This roadmap tracks key improvements and enhancements to align the architecture more closely with human cognitive models. Each task is categorized by module and priority.

## üß© Core Cognitive Modules

### üîÅ DPAD-Style RNN
- [ ] **Add training loop** for both behavior and residual prediction (cross-entropy/MSE loss)
- [ ] **Support nonlinear mappings** for all model elements (A‚Ä≤, K, Cy, Cz)
- [ ] Enable **adaptive latent dimension selection** based on behavioral salience
- [ ] Implement **flexible nonlinearity selection** as in original DPAD paper (auto model selection)

### üß† Short-Term Memory (STM)
- [ ] Fix `get_recent_items()` bug (`self.memory_data` reference)
- [ ] Implement **context chaining** (sequential episode links)
- [ ] Add **recency and attention decay scoring curve** logging
- [ ] Support **STM reheating** based on meta-cognitive boost

### üóÉÔ∏è Long-Term Memory (LTM)
- [ ] Add **contextual and temporal indexing** to episodic memory
- [ ] Implement **multi-hop semantic search** with concept chaining
- [ ] Support **emotion/motivation tagging** (optional metadata fields)
- [ ] Introduce **forgetting threshold** via attention + recency scores

### üåô Dream State Processor
- [ ] Allow optional **HDBSCAN clustering** for noise-tolerant memory compression
- [ ] Implement **reinforcement-based memory retention** using priority feedback
- [ ] Enable **replay-based consolidation** (e.g., latent state replay to retrain DPAD)
- [ ] Visualize STM ‚Üí LTM transitions via PCA/t-SNE

### üß≠ Meta-Cognition Layer
- [ ] Replace linear fatigue decay with **sigmoid decay + recovery**
- [ ] Add **feedback loops** to boost STM entries during high salience
- [ ] Simulate **attention modulation** via task difficulty estimation
- [ ] Create a **strategy regulator** to prioritize perception, memory, or planning modules

---

## üß† Planning & Executive Function

- [ ] Introduce **Executive Planner Module** (simulates PFC)
  - SLM-based goal tracking and reasoning
  - Supports task breakdown and memory retrieval triggers
- [ ] Connect planner to LTM + STM to access relevant context
- [ ] Visualize goal stack and planned actions via dashboard

---

## üß™ Evaluation & Testing

- [ ] Add unit tests for all modules with synthetic memory examples
- [ ] Create benchmarks for:
  - [ ] Recall fidelity (episodic vs semantic)
  - [ ] Attentional decay and recovery
  - [ ] Memory consolidation precision
- [ ] Simulate **biases** (recency, confirmation, salience-driven memory)
- [ ] Design **human-likeness scoring system** (Turing-style behavior metrics)

---

## üß∞ DevOps / Tooling

- [ ] Add GitHub Actions CI pipeline
  - Auto test on PRs
  - Code formatting (black, flake8)
- [ ] Generate module documentation with **MkDocs** or **Sphinx**
- [ ] Add API reference for Streamlit and cognitive loop methods

---

## üìä Visualization & Interface

- [ ] Expand Streamlit dashboard:
  - [ ] STM memory map projection (PCA/UMAP)
  - [ ] Attention & fatigue over time
  - [ ] Trigger dream cycle manually
- [ ] Add **timeline view** of episodic memory formation
- [ ] Support input replay & memory path tracing

### üîÑ Update cadence
This roadmap will be reviewed and updated **monthly**. Contributions and suggestions welcome via Issues and PRs.
